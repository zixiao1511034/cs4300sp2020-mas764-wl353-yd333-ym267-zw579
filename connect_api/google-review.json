The live music with the mulled wine creates quite a cheerful atmosphere which is almost unique to Christmas.\nIt's not a terribly big market, so adults will probably find one visit enough  but families might benefit from the season pass.

The vendors got worse (used to be way more German ornament stands). The price keeps going up but what's inside stays the same. And yes, you are not publicly funded neither are most other businesses and they don't hijack their prices to that extent. Honestly, $15 to get in? I used to tell everyone they must go there, I would make several visits a season myself and bring new people with me but over the last few years, this year especially, I found it harder and harder to defend their price increases and the need/want to actually go there. Honestly, I don't recommend it anymore. I feel bad for the vendors as they pay to be there and only have a month to sell off their goods, it's hard for them to keep their prices steady. Some travel in from Europe. Vancouver German Christmas Market, you need to do better. Go back to a smaller venue if needed but prices need to come down if you wish to keep your client base. Sure tourists may go there but the locals are definitely opting out.",

The cag is the oldest gallery of its type in Vancouver and is worth a look, won't take much more than 30-50 minutes. They offer free lunchtime tours which are a great way to be introduced to the space. There's also a small bookshop and reference area. Free entry.\n#cag #gallery #modernart",
