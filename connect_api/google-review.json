Never heard anything of it but it seems important in some ways to me because it was the first thing I visited after I returned to New York. That never happened to me before. I spent about an hour there before they closed and I was amazed how hard work and love and dedication they put into it. It\u2019s art. And it\u2019s so quiet and peaceful compared to crazy Manhattan. It makes you feel safe, peaceful, honored. I am not very religious or anything but this was a special moment. So I highly recommend visiting it and try to appreciate your life.

It was a great experience. The company was fantastic, the appetizers were delicious, only to be outdone but the fabulous main course, and the desert was tremendous. The staff was excellent. They were very attentive to our needs and desires. Service was excellent!\n\nOur group had a wonderful view of the lake from our table but it soon became a minor problem as the sun was shining through the window into the eyes of about half of the guests. It was requested that the exterior awnings be lowered to provide some shade to the affected guests but we were told that the awnings were in a fixed height position and could not be adjusted downward.\n\nThe inability to provide shade to our table is the only thing that is stopping me from giving 5 stars. I would gladly return to this facility but I would seek a shaded seating location or a room without a view. In all other aspects, our luncheon experience was superb.",

Navigating throughout the website to buy the tickets was pretty easy, and we just ended up getting the most basic tickets - ground level. To order the tickets to go on higher levels/inside the Statue of Liberty, you will definitely have to order at least 4-6 months ahead of time.",

I was working as a performer on show at NBC and the tour came through the studio. So I  guess that's why they want me to rate it.  Actually several tours came through our studio (it was a very long day) and every one on the tour listened to the tour guide and we're very respectful by not taking any photos from what I could see. Even I can't take photos inside before showtime. Sometimes when the tour comes through my colleagues and I don't even hear them but we do see them. If you are visiting NYC and want a nice diversion out of the ordinary tourist attractions, come on by and take the tour. You never know who you might see! \ud83d\ude0e",

          "text": "Situated deep inside Central Park, it's a nice spot to stop by and relax. Good history background and its absolutely free to visit. There's a gift shop where you can buy yourself souvenirs. I recommend going to the top where you get a view of the central park. The top is not wheelchair accessible and the stairway is really narrow, only one person a time so when it's fully packed it gets excessively difficult to ascend or descend the stairway. There are staff on site who help monitor and manage the stairway traffic and offer any general assistance. A photogenic place and very touristic.",

However during spontaneous walk, my wife and I discovered mentioned castle. Even it's not real medieval castle, it is very beautiful. At the top there is breath-taking view, cool spot for selfies :) And it's not crowded area (Feb 2020).",
