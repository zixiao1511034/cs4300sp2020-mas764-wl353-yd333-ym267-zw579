Never heard anything of it but it seems important in some ways to me because it was the first thing I visited after I returned to New York. That never happened to me before. I spent about an hour there before they closed and I was amazed how hard work and love and dedication they put into it. It\u2019s art. And it\u2019s so quiet and peaceful compared to crazy Manhattan. It makes you feel safe, peaceful, honored. I am not very religious or anything but this was a special moment. So I highly recommend visiting it and try to appreciate your life.

It's beautiful, spacious, and kept clean. Nearby are pieces of the Berlin Wall, the raging bull statute, a viewpoint for the Statue of Liberty, and several beautifully made memorials for the Armed Forces. I highly recommend walking about this entire area but definitely make sure to wander through Battery Park. Castle Clinton, the immigrants statue, and several other sites are a must see.",

They were very attentive to our needs and desires. Service was excellent!\n\nOur group had a wonderful view of the lake from our table but it soon became a minor problem as the sun was shining through the window into the eyes of about half of the guests. It was requested that the exterior awnings be lowered to provide some shade to the affected guests but we were told that the awnings were in a fixed height position and could not be adjusted downward.\n\nThe inability to provide shade to our table is the only thing that is stopping me from giving 5 stars.

While this might very much seem like a place that you'd organize day trips for toddlers, I took a leap of faith and organized a birthday surprise for my partner that started from this place and we ended up having a wonderful time.\n\nThe tickets on entry might seem a tad too expensive (~40 something) but believe me that it's completely worth it. The place is divided into multiple floors so lets start from the top. There is an aquarium on the last floor and it's remarkable how well it has been maintained. I was thoroughly impressed to see an aquarium of such scale to be located within a science centre. The other floors are filled with interesting technical exhibits and if you're a geek at heart then you're surely going to love it every bit.\n\nI'd highly highly recommend paying a visit to the Dome Theatre [irrespective of the show that's currently playing]. The audio visual experience is absolutely stunning and given the smart duration of a show [~45 minutes], it's unlikely that you'll be bored.\n\nAlso, there's a cute little cafe which serves pizzas and other essentials and a wonderful gift shop on the ground floor that deserves a stop-over as well.\n\nCertainly a place to cherish and visit once in a while for folks belonging to all ages.",

I was surprised there was an aquarium in a science center. I think that's the first time in my life I experience that. There are also some film showings that some people can enjoy. This is a perfect place to take kids.",

The park is pet friendly \ud83d\udc08 \ud83d\udc15 with areas designated for pets to play. There's a burger joint with one of the most amazing burgers I've ever had. It's relatively small so if you want a huge space to run or play with your pets then I suggest another park. There are numerous public benches where you can sit and relax. \n\ud83d\udc31\ud83d\udc15\u200d\ud83e\uddba\ud83e\uddae\ud83d\udc29\ud83e\uddbd\ud83e\uddbc",

There's food inside and outside of the park. I love going to Eatly across the street, getting food, and having a picnic at the park! The fountains are so pretty and the flowers are colorful and beautiful as well. I always stop here on my trips to NYC. Definitely a must see!",
