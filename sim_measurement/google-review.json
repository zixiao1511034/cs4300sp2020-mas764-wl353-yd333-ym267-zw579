Only one negative thing to mention was the host who took our name - he was obviously having a bad day and had a bad attitude.

The wait staff is always wonderful, but the quality of the food is declining. Yesterday I ordered chicken and waffles, and what I received was one small waffle and three chicken wings. The wings were absolutely coated in paprika but had no other seasoning--they were somehow over-seasoned and underseasoned at the same time. They were rubbery and didn't go well with the waffle at all. For $15, this was terrible. Overall, the portions seem to be shrinking and the quality isn't what it used to be. I won't be returning unless there's a serious improvement in the food standards.",

Also if you go up on the stages to dance make sure you have good footing because they do get drinks spilled on them and get a little slippery (coming from someone who has a big bruise right now lol).

Their gouda mac and cheese could have used more of a kick, but the sauce for their fries was quite good.  Pretty pricey, though, at least at the food truck.  The mac and cheese should have been more like $8 or $9 for a full serving, not $13.  Fries were a fairly high $6.  Not the worst, but a bit high for how the food tasted.  Otherwise, they operate a fairly high-quality food truck.  I got my food pretty quickly, too.  Be aware, however, that their food truck menu is limited compared to their full service menu.",

It's warm,\u00a0smooth, and nostalgic. Taste like the mashed potatoes I made with my family when I was a child.\n\nThe\u00a0inside\u00a0of burger bun has been crispily grilled. Normally I'm not a big fan of blue cheese. But this time, the blue cheese goes very well with the lamb patty, picked shallots, fresh arugula, and light homemade pesto. It's PERFECT. I didn't need to use the ketchup, salt, or pepper at all. This dish's taste is well-balanced with a variety of texture and taste. Since both blue cheese and picked shallots have strong taste, the rest of the ingredients have mild taste. The whole meal feels very hearty and fresh.\u00a0\n\nThis meal easily found its place in my personal list of favourite burgers!\n\nPs. The non-alcoholic house cooler that I ordered (Ginger-lavender lemonade) came late (when I already finished half of my burger). But the waitress is very attentive. She came to tell me before the burger arrived that the drink was going to be late because they had to make it from scratch this time. I appreciate that they didn't compromise on food quality and make sure their customer understand. In the end, the taste wasn't to my liking but it was an interesting taste!",

I was convinced that this town just didn\u2019t know how to make a good pizza, and that the only wings available were those terrible gummy ones.  Then, after passing by Northeast Pizza and Beer Co for two years, I finally stopped in.  AMAZING.  Unlike almost every other pizza in Ithaca, this pizza had the ideal amount of sauce and cheese. The toppings were also excellent.  The wings were exactly what I\u2019ve been searching for, crispy without being burnt.  Also a quality sauce on top.  The seasoned fries were also phenomenal.  I will be ranting and raving about this amazing restaurant to everyone I know.  And by the way, their home brewed beer was also phenomenal.  If you\u2019ve given up on Ithaca pizza, I promise that there\u2019s hope.  Northeast Pizza and Beer co has the only good pizza and wings in this town.  And I\u2019m confident in that conclusion.

I\u2019d rate the pizza and wings a solid three.\n\nMy rating is going to be based on service and once the server I review is no longer working there, I will delete my review. We frequent Northeast about once every other week for the last four years and are fairly regular customers.\n\nOur server was the worst I\u2019ve ever had. She came to take our order and repeated it several times, once leaving a part off so I asked if she had it correct and she repeated it again, then again. She then came back again to confirm what our order was. She brought my husbands drink and my son\u2019s and asked again what my drink order was. The pizza order for the table next to us was wrong and she didn\u2019t offer to have a new one made or take it off their bill. They were a family with young children and the mom finally had to go up to the bar to pay their tab. She disappeared for ten minutes during service and the bar tender had to manage tables. After the one family had to pay at the bar, three other tables went to the bar to pay because she didn\u2019t take their tab to them. The family next to us left ten minutes after we sat down and their dirty dishes were still sitting there when we left (which was about an hour later). She had to ask the bartender three times what food belonged to what tables... The service was just terrible. So I\u2019d recommend their food but the next time we go, if the same server is waiting tables we will turn around and go somewhere else.",

Of the  first three that came out, 2 were cold and the rice was barely warm. We sent them back. 15 minutes later they come back out, and were just warm.  \n\nOf the several other plates we ordered, the pork buns and pork belly plates were warm but you couldn\u2019t even bite thru the pork belly it was so tough.  3 of the other plates were also just cold, but due to the lack of a waiter that was trying to serve about 40 other people by himself he never came back. \n\nWe honestly had decent food but it was cold, except for the pork dishes.  When we spoke to the manager she said she\u2019d give us free dessert and really didn\u2019t seem to care about what had happened.  Let\u2019s see, all of your food I got already had issues, so you want to give me more, lol.  Eventually she took 3 dishes off the bill.  Thinking back we should have just left after the cold food issue on the first 3 dishes. \n\nWord to the wise, if they are busy, go somewhere else and definitely don\u2019t sit upstairs.",

The furniture is pretty dodgy, and there is no AC or ventilation down there at all, so consider popping upstairs to cool off and get some fresh air.     I'm sure there are better options around collegetown than this place. I can't really speak for the service or drinks, since it was a Cornell hosted event for summer college, they just had soda.

When we went the \"entertainment\" was this one guy randomly playing a guitar with psychadelic music and some sort of video/power point in the background, it was just strange and not at all what we were expecting or hoping for a fun night out.

          "text": "Jan 10, 2020\nWent with high expectation and respect for the place given the recommendation from a friend who knows the owner from liquid state. Would have liked to have an experience like the rest are describing here.  Unfortunately for me, however, the Owner that everyone seems to revere is somewhat of a pretentious pucker to people who have yet come to understand the art and technicality of whisky cocktails and or how to choose. They have a vast collection of bourbons, whisky, scotch and more I am sure. So how does one choose from the diversity?\n\nNew to this experience, I kindly asked the bartender that I was looking for a floral whisky on the sweeter side to sip on.  He seems bothered by the fact that I am asking for a recommendation.  He begrudgingly points to six different bottles (which isn't really a recommendation when you aren't describing the drinks themselves).  Having to make a blind decision, on his expansive description of the drinks /s, I think about which to choose.\n\nAt this point he has become agitated and RUDELY asks if I am ever going to ever order anything, which is awkward because the lady working beside him was already in the works of making me the whisky sour I had ordered before I even spoke to him. His regulars/friends sitting at the bar even proceed to mock me among themselves.\n\nI have NEVER felt so belittled, so RIDICULED for trying to learn and purchase a good from an establishment that Dean, the owner describes the establishment as a place for, \"Getting people to try little things that open up their palates and then they want to come back and try that again.\u201dthemselves.  This place clearly only caters to those that understand the process.  His keenness to customer service blows my mind.  I didn't even know they had a menu! Not even a suggestion if I'd like to see it. Regardless, perhaps even uniquely on this night, there was no room for kindness or patience for me.    He pours my chilled whisky as he bellows under his breath, \"your whiskey CHILLED,\" as if to throw the last verbal blow before finally having to end our interaction.  At this point I am feeling quite attacked, isolated and unwelcome that I casually and gracefully extend my middle finger to the bartender.  He proceeds to ask me to leave and grabs the drink from my hands.  I leave without protest relieved I no longer have to endure such a hostile and unwelcoming environment. \n\nIndeed, this place has earned its name wholeheartedly.  \"Nowhere special,\" hostile, unfriendly, demeaning and a place where social gatekeepers can sip on their egos.\n\nFeel free to respond here Mr. bartender. I'd love to hear how you felt it was appropriate to treat me the way you did.",

          "text": "Solid eats. As the other reviewers have said it is a little pricey but you are getting awesome food and I don't mind paying a little more. When I go away for a week or weekend I just don't hold back, if there is something new, unique and fun, I want to try it. I personally didn't think the prices were out of control I think they were quite all right. I have paid more money for really subpar food before, and all of the food here is aces.  Our server was awesome. Their beer list is equally awesome, You can find some beers here but you won't find elsewhere. A good amount of German, and some Polish beer as well. I think I would call this comfort food, it feels like gastro pub? We started with some gandalfini fries. They were terrific, a lot of flavor there, executed nicely.  I got the fried chicken and greens. Do it. As the others have said you won't regret it. She got the pancetta (absolutely five star) with some fingerling potatoes.  For dessert we got the donuts of the day which were absolutely stellar. I believe they had an Earl Gray glaze or reduction and the texture was more like crumb cake, dynamite .it wasn't overly sweet which would have ruined it IMO.  Now for the constructive criticism... And I didn't feel like it warranted taking a half a point or a point off. I firmly believe that the music sets the feel, tone and mood. The bluegrass style lively music made me want to drink up and laugh. There was some music that was really really slow dark and down the place was a little bit empty at first so it was kind of droning. Kind of like Radiohead but more sad. I like the upbeat bluegrass stuff though, it fits the feel and style more of the place. Without a doubt 100% I will be coming back to eat and drink here again. I really wish my hometown had more places like this.",

Why would anyone proclaim that to an entire restaurant? They literally sell beer here anyway so drinking alcohol isn\u2019t even an issue!

It is also pretty cheap for a bubble tea place.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this place is that all their flavorings are powder based; they do not use the higher quality syrups that some other places do. This makes a noticeable impact on the flavor.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this place a 3.5 out of 5 but I've bumped it up to 4 because of their massive selection of flavors/teas and ability to mix/match and get hot or cold for pretty much any flavor. Other places are way more limited.",

The atmosphere was pretty chill and relaxed and the servers were friendly.  The bad:. The sandwich was tiny, as well as the salad (the picture shows half of the sandwich).  The bread with the sandwich was sourdough, which I thought would be artisan type bread, but looked like it was simply purchased at a grocery store.  That tiny sandwich took 30 minutes to make, and it didn't seem like it was super busy.  I had to return my silverware as they were very dirty.  Cool place, but don't expect to leave full.   I was going to have the soup but they were sold out.  Oh, cash and checks only.\n\nTo the owner, thanks for the response and owning the silverware mistake.  Owning of mistakes means you care and are willing to change, upping a star for that. :)",

The path along the waterfall is closed during the winter but the trail along the back meanders through the woods and is a lovely scenic trail. The best season visit is early summer while the falls are still flowing with water consistently. Summers here can get dry and there is usually water flowing but occasionally it is dry, which is still a magnificent scene but the sound of rushing water adds a breathtaking allure. The fall colors at Buttermilk are a sight to see and a frozen waterfall is stunning. Depending on the type of hiker you are, the trek is pleasant no matter the weather. If hiking with children the back trail is safer and less strenuous but the stairway is close to the falls and gets you  into interesting coves and close to the falls and into the water in one area. Buttermilk falls is one of the three falls that you must visit if coming to Ithaca. There are several entrances but the lower Buttermilk trail is the easiest to see the falls. Upper Buttermilk will allow you to hike down the falls to get a great view at the end and then hike back up.",

          "text": "I attended a service here once. The organ and architecture are absolutely beautiful and the people also seemed nice from my limited interaction, but my experience was overall poor. I got in late so I sat a little near the back. Shortly after I sat down, a row of teenagers sat in the row in front of me and then proceeded to open their phones and play games. And, all of them kept playing. It was quite impressive actually- it was all through the music, all through the sermon, all through the prayers- I heard a bump and looked up, and they're they were, playing onward! The only time they actually stopped playing on their phones was when the offering plate came by and they threw in some change. But not to be stopped, they kept on! This really irked me because it became apparent that these weren't kids off the street or anything- but rather, they were those who were raised in the church. And while I understand you can't keep tabs on your kids at all time during the sermon and that sometimes kids will want to do silly things in service with their friends, this seemed to be a custom that hadn't been challenged by anyone. \n\nIn general, the music selection was also poor- the songs revolved around singing how great we are, which felt more like the modern pop psychology more so than traditional Presbyterianism. The sermon was of the same caliber. \n\nAlso, one of the 5-star reviews of this church is from the pastor herself. That just seems a little bit underhanded for people genuinely looking for churches in the area.",

          "text": "First thing to note about Heritage is that they are a painting/service company as well as a real estate leasing company with dozens of properties. This review reflects the housing side of the company, although I know for certain they are both run by similar people/owners.\n\nThey've got an immense amount of property in the Ithaca College/Tompkins county area and absolutely prey on students. Be very wary of their business tactics, lack of communication, and be prepared to lose money. Spent two years in a home that took minimal damages and yet lost well over half of an almost $7,000 deposit because of an almost $3,000 fee for painting. We were instructed to use nails instead of command strips or another similar method to preserve the walls. Several of my roommates spackled after the fact, but learned since we spackled they'd repaint and if we didn't, they'd spackle and repaint anyway and charge us for both. Previous tenants definitely took poor care of the place, and in an effort to avoid their same issues we repaired, and attempted to return it to the state that we found it in, if not better in some cases. \n\nWe changed landlords multiple times (3-4) within our leasing period (because of internal Heritage issues we were told) and were informed with incorrect information from each and every one until graduating. Saw the warnings of several others prior, but went ahead anyway with the lease. Experienced issues such as our driveway not being plowed, potholes damaging vehicles, required dumpster fees, Wasp/Bee nests and inefficient repairs requiring multiple revisits to name only a few. Very poorly run and no sign of improvement or responsibility.. and for a company who attempts to find young tenants you'd imagine they would've adopted more updated means of paying rent rather than hand delivering checks/cash to a mailbox nailed to a wall. This is not to say you can not have a good experience with them, but if you take any of this to heart understand you will be facing issues in the same manner myself and my roommates did.",

Me simply asking questions she felt I should have seen online is what triggered it all. Kept trying to tell me to go to the website or call the county clerks office for info. The brand new receptionist Sidney was such a delight to talk to initially. It's a shame someone who is new has more decency and manners than your 20 year employee. Also, if you see a unit you are interested in, even though it says a date it's available, it's not. They post their units that could be available if the current tenant doesn't renew their lease. So you will develop an interest for something that isn't even available. But Michelle has been in the business for 20 years and all places do this. No, just deceptive, devious and money driven individuals would do that. I'm actually glad I saw your true colors early. Your red flags saved me money, time wasted and my sanity for having to deal with you during a lease agreement.",

Took 2 months to have security deposit returned with dozens of phone calls and emails ignored, until a lawyer was mentioned and then conveniently immediately responded. When I did receive my security deposit back they came up with random maintenance, cleaning and painting fees that were completely ludicrous as I left the place spotless and actually better then when I moved in. They are the cheapest rental properties in the Lansing area for a reason. If I could give them less than a 1 star rating I would. Save your time, money and frustration and rent elsewhere.",

It's setting on the inlet is picturesque and coupled with the mature trees and natural setting provides a nice venue to relax and pursue recreation. Located in what I refer to as \"Park Alley\" Cass Park offers plenty of convenient parking. It's outdoor pool is well maintained and popular during the summer months. It's covered but seasonal ice rink features a beautiful architectural roof that allow for an open feeling. The changing facilities are clean, well maintained and modest. The community is involved in seeking improvements to this facility which is a great place to enjoy year round family fun.",

          "text": "This camp was amazing! I attended the Fisher Camp (One week long overnight camp), and had so much fun! It was so heartbreaking to have to leave, and me and my brother waited excitedly for the next summer, to return to the forest. Primitive Pursuits is amazing because of just how aware and one with the environment you become after one week at this camp. We learned how to become a part of the forest, camped, sang over campfires, and so much more! The food was really good, and tasted just like a homemade family meal. The camping and sleeping in tents wa definitely my favorite part! I definitely recommend this camp to pre-teen or teen. The only recommendation i would have is to make it longer, because of how amazing it is and how hard it is to leave!",

I believe these falls are called Ithaca Falls and they are within city limits. There is a small parking lot very close to the falls so the walk is very minimal. The falls are no wimpy falls because they are wide and the velocity of the water is pretty impressive! Be safe and stay away from the bottom of the falls, they have taken lives as the sign says. Also you can travel up the gorge for a cool hike. I am sure this place is popular with the locals and students.",

Of course mostly seasonal vegetables and fruits we're the high light.  Also vendors selling meats, pies, cookies, pastries, and many more delicious offerings.  And the artists brought their wares to  entice the artsy shoppers.  I selected fresh pink beets, small potatoes, smoked honey and  homemade mild hot Italian sausage. You can even have breakfast made to order.  All in all it was a pleasure going to the Ithaca Farmers Market.  Enjoy!",

It appears from other photos that water flow may be dependent on rainfall(obviously) but on release from dam above. I felt very fortunate in that I was able to see awesome flow and the extra treat of ice forming on adjacent sides of falls as well as icicle formation on gorge wall features.

Over the course of three weeks, I developed extremely close friendships with people inside and outside of my class that come from all over the world. For anyone who is thinking about applying and/or attending, I would strongly advise that you do so. :)",

Every part of my experience was beyond incredible, from academics, on-site resources, locale, food, and campus. Beyond the beautiful intricacies of Cornell\u2019s grounds and the town around it, my Professors were incredibly helpful and intelligent, making sure each student had all the help they needed. Furthermore, the independence an adulthood of the program is outstanding; I really felt like a college student while I was there. The gorgeous variety of study rooms and resources such as the libraries and writing center also provided incredible help with finding exactly what I needed at any time. I could go on about CUSC for paragraphs and paragraphs, but instead you should just go see for yourself. It\u2019s beyond worth it.",

          "text": "I have to admit that I was extremely skeptical about what people were saying about the \"close-knit\" nature of Johnson and if one could really feel the difference. But the reality is that although ~280 classmates and a total of ~600+ overall full-time MBA students is quite a large number of people, the fact that everything happens in one place and that the students are so actively involved in everything, makes it feel much more like a family. And the \"close-knit\" nature really does affect the MBA experience in that there isn't much space to \"hide\" in the crowd and you really get to know your classmates well. \n\nThere has been a lot of criticism lately from both internal sources and external sources regarding the direction of the program and how the school is branding itself. Personally, I do believe the school realizes this gap and is doing a fairly good job at trying to listen to the constructive feedback and address these ongoing issues. And regardless of what the school ends up doing, no school is perfect and there will always be complaints. \n\nWith that all being said, I believe that if you remove all of the strengths that the school tries to promote (tech, entrepreneurship, IB, etc) its true core strength lies in the ethical leaders that the school produces. Strong ethics and leadership is something that I see consistently with all of my classmates and the alums. Because of the way the school is structured, I see those characteristics as the only truly salient factors that distinguish between those that succeed and those that fail. The school IS strong in all of these areas simply because it's a place that tries to offer its students an overly abundant number of resources to cater to anyone's potential desires. Really, everything you need to succeed is here and if it's not, it's very likely available in the greater Cornell University community where there are seemingly endless word-class resources at your fingertips. Therefore, in order to succeed at Johnson, one needs to be very proactive and decisive when determining how to spend their 2 short years here. \n\nSure, the school's not perfect and they can improve in many areas, but that doesn't happen without a proactive student body and a community that really has a large interest in it's overall success. I think that Johnson currently has all of the right pieces to produce a top 10 business school experience (great diverse student body and excellent faculty) and that it's on the verge of doing so. The reason that it's not quite there yet, is that the students and the administration need to work more effectively together to execute a coordinated effort to improve the school as a whole. Once they can accomplish that, the sky's the limit!",

They left me on hold for ten minutes, and then accused me of being late when they finally picked up and said they'd have to reschedule my appointment. I insisted that I was NOT late. The person on the phone insisted that the counselor I was meant to speak to was apparently occupied even though I had been scheduled to meet with her, and was told to wait and that they'd call back. Half an hour later, I heard nothing so I called back, finally got to speak with the counselor, only to be told she was too busy to speak with me. This experience is not vastly different from the other experiences I've had with this place.\n\nHere's the gist. If you want someone to make you feel completely dismissed or want to deal with complete incompetence, then call up Cornell health, they've got you covered. If you want actual medical help, go somewhere else.",
